    "        - **Rename Columns**: Columns are renamed to have consistent naming conventions and be more meaningful for analysis.\n",
    "        - **Remove 'X' Gender Values**: Any rows with 'X' as a gender label are removed as this represents incomplete or erroneous data.\n",
    "        - **Map Gender Codes to Labels**: Gender codes are mapped to more readable labels (e.g., 'M' -> 'Male', 'F' -> 'Female').\n",
    "        - **Ensure Proper DateTime Format**: We ensure that the `date_time` column is in the correct format (i.e., datetime objects), allowing for time-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Merge Datasets**:\n",
    "        - **Merge Demographic Datasets**: We combine the demographic data (client information such as age, tenure, balance) into a single dataset.\n",
    "        - **Concatenate Web Interactions Dataset**: The web interactions (client's steps through the online process) are merged with the demographic data based on the `client_id`.\n",
    "        - **Final Merge on `client_id`**: After all data is cleaned and preprocessed, we merge all datasets on the common `client_id` column to create a comprehensive dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Segment by Experiment Group**:\n",
    "        - **Control and Test Groups**: The dataset is split into two groups based on the `variation` column: the Control group (clients using the traditional UI) and the Test group (clients using the new UI with contextual prompts).\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Sort Data**:\n",
    "        - **Sort by client_id, visit_id, process_step, and date_time**: This ensures that the data is ordered by the client's journey through the process, from their first visit to the confirmation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Age Group Categorization**:\n",
    "        - **Assign Age Groups**: Based on defined age bins, we categorize clients into age groups (e.g., under 30, 30-39, 40-49, 50+). This categorization is applied to the `df_merged`, as well as to the `control` and `test` datasets to facilitate age-based analysis.\n",

    "        **Clean Datasets**:\n",
    "        - **Load Data**: We begin by loading the raw data from various sources.\n",
    "        - **Drop Missing Values**: Any missing values in critical columns (like `client_id`, `process_step`, etc.) are removed to ensure that we only work with complete data.\n",
    "        - **Rename Columns**: Columns are renamed to have consistent naming conventions and be more meaningful for analysis.\n",
    "        - **Remove 'X' Gender Values**: Any rows with 'X' as a gender label are removed as this represents incomplete or erroneous data.\n",
    "        - **Map Gender Codes to Labels**: Gender codes are mapped to more readable labels (e.g., 'M' -> 'Male', 'F' -> 'Female').\n",
    "        - **Ensure Proper DateTime Format**: We ensure that the `date_time` column is in the correct format (i.e., datetime objects), allowing for time-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Merge Datasets**:\n",
    "        - **Merge Demographic Datasets**: We combine the demographic data (client information such as age, tenure, balance) into a single dataset.\n",
    "        - **Concatenate Web Interactions Dataset**: The web interactions (client's steps through the online process) are merged with the demographic data based on the `client_id`.\n",
    "        - **Final Merge on `client_id`**: After all data is cleaned and preprocessed, we merge all datasets on the common `client_id` column to create a comprehensive dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Segment by Experiment Group**:\n",
    "        - **Control and Test Groups**: The dataset is split into two groups based on the `variation` column: the Control group (clients using the traditional UI) and the Test group (clients using the new UI with contextual prompts).\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Sort Data**:\n",
    "        - **Sort by client_id, visit_id, process_step, and date_time**: This ensures that the data is ordered by the client's journey through the process, from their first visit to the confirmation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Age Group Categorization**:\n",
    "        - **Assign Age Groups**: Based on defined age bins, we categorize clients into age groups (e.g., under 30, 30-39, 40-49, 50+). This categorization is applied to the `df_merged`, as well as to the `control` and `test` datasets to facilitate age-based analysis.\n",

This could indicate that the intuitive interface or contextual prompts helped users to feel more confident and successful in completing the steps.\n",

    "          A lower time spent at each step in the **Test group** compared to the **Control group** would suggest that the new design is more efficient. This can be interpreted as users moving through the process more quickly, likely due to the improved clarity or guidance offered by the new UI design.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Error Rates**:  \n",
    "          A reduction in error rates in the **Test group** would suggest that the new design is more intuitive and user-friendly. This could mean that fewer users encountered confusion or made mistakes during the process, likely because the contextual prompts and simplified steps helped guide them more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Bounce Rates**:  \n",
    "          If the **Test group** has a lower bounce rate compared to the **Control group**, it suggests that the new design is better at keeping users engaged throughout the process. A lower bounce rate would indicate that users are more likely to stay in the process, reducing drop-offs or exits at any given step, which is a good indicator of user retention and interest.\n",
